This repository is the official page of my seminar paper "Lightweight Text Classification". It was done in the Winter semester of 2021/2022 at the University Ulm.

### Presentation
The presentation was on 7th march 2022 (2022-03-07) at 9:45am in an online zoom call.

### Abstract
This paper looks at three different algorithms: skip-gram, fastText, and MDLText for lightweight text classification. It compares them and discusses the impacts to find the most suitable use case for each classification algorithm.

The comparison of the algorithms includes:
What the algorithm does and how it differs from its predecessor if it has one. 
The document type and language of the dataset the algorithm is using.
And lastly, the accuracy and stability of the final result concerning the points mentioned earlier.
Lightweight text classifications are fast and easy algorithms to organize a text to one previously trained class or tag. Instead of a complex deep neural network, they use a few levels of a simple neural network.

The categories that are a problem are:
As an example, the accuracy of the algorithm might be better in multiple languages than in English or the document type could influence the accuracy.
